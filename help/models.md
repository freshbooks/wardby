# Models and pricing

Wardby prices and routes every model call from one catalog: the models this
release ships, overlaid with this deployment's own additions and overrides.
An agent can use a model only when it's in the catalog and its provider has
credentials configured here.

## The five tools

| Tool            | Scope          | What it does                                                                              |
| --------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_models`   | `agents:read`  | Every active catalog entry (or, with `includeDisabled: true`, disabled ones too).         |
| `get_model`     | `agents:read`  | One entry by `modelId`; for an override, also the shipped entry it shadows.               |
| `set_model`     | `models:admin` | Adds or completely replaces one entry. Every field is required.                           |
| `disable_model` | `models:admin` | Removes a model from routing without deleting its pricing history.                        |
| `reset_model`   | `models:admin` | Removes every row for a model id, reverting to the shipped entry (if any) or removing it. |

Reading the catalog needs only `agents:read` — no secrets live in an entry.
Changing it needs `models:admin`, honored only for a caller whose Wardby role
grants it: `admin`, or the narrower `model-manager` role.

An entry's `origin` is `shipped` or `override`; `routable` says whether this
deployment can actually route to it right now; `shippedDiffers` (overrides of
a shipped model only) says whether your override has drifted from the
current shipped values. See [`docs/models.md`](../docs/models.md) for the
full field reference.

## Adding or overriding a model

```json
{
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "modelId": "claude-example-model",
  "encoding": "o200k_base",
  "inputPerMTok": 0.0,
  "outputPerMTok": 0.0,
  "cachedInputPerMTok": 0.0,
  "cacheWritePerMTok": 0.0,
  "efforts": ["low", "medium", "high"],
  "thinkingMode": "adaptive",
  "sourceUrl": "https://example.com/replace-with-the-providers-own-pricing-page"
}
```

The rates above are placeholders. Copy the provider's own published rates for
that exact model — including its cache read and cache write rates — from its
pricing page, and point `sourceUrl` at that page; never compute cache rates
from `inputPerMTok` with a multiplier.

`set_model` refuses (409) a `modelId` another provider already owns. A
shipped id always belongs to its shipped provider — permanently; no other
provider can ever claim it, not even by disabling or resetting the override.
A non-shipped id already claimed by another provider (its row active or
disabled) is freed only by that provider's `reset_model`; `disable_model`
alone never frees it, since the disabled row still reserves the id.

`thinkingMode` (`adaptive`, `manual`, or `none`) must match what the exact
model accepts. Getting it wrong doesn't fail at `set_model` — it fails later,
when a run calls the model, with `unsupported_anthropic_feature`.

Catalog changes take effect on the writing process immediately, and on every
other wardby process within `WARDBY_MODEL_CATALOG_REFRESH_SECONDS` (default
45). A run already in progress keeps the catalog entry it started with, so
disabling or repricing a model never changes a run already under way — only
new runs.

If this deployment delegates to an identity provider, define `models:admin`
there before relying on it, and map the `model-manager` role (or `admin`) to
the people who maintain pricing — see
[Configure identity and privileged access](identity-and-access.md).

If a run can't use a model, see
[Model not available](errors/model-unavailable.md).
