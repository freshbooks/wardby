/**
 * `warmUpExecutor` is the single fire-and-forget call site `startMcp` uses to start an executor's
 * start-up warm-up (e.g. KubernetesJobLauncher's memoized cluster preflight) when a long-running
 * server process starts (`wardby mcp`, and `wardby serve` through it) — never from a one-shot CLI
 * command, which never calls it at all. These tests cover the call site's own contract in isolation,
 * without a database or cluster: the launcher-level preflight/memoization behavior is covered by
 * kubernetes.test.ts, and the Executor-level delegation by container.test.ts and routing.test.ts.
