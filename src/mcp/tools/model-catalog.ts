/**
 * The model catalog over MCP (docs/models.md). Reading it (list_models,
 * get_model) needs only agents:read: anyone deciding what to put in an
 * Agent.model needs to see what's routable, what it costs, and whether it's
 * shipped or a deployment override — entries hold no secrets. Changing it
 * (set_model, disable_model, reset_model) needs models:admin, a privileged
 * scope honoured only with a role granting it (model-manager or admin;
 * resource-server.ts): an entry decides what every principal's runs on that
 * model id are priced and shaped as. Each change is audit-logged (event
 * models.catalog.<action>). Runs already dispatched keep the entry they
 * started with (CatalogEntry snapshots, not live lookups) — a write here
 * never reprices or reshapes a run in flight.
 *
 * Correctness of a write never depends on the process's installed
 * CatalogStore, which can be stale (it polls on an interval) or briefly
 * unreachable:
 *  - `set_model`'s provider-conflict check reads `ctx.db` directly (plus the
 *    static shipped catalog, which is never stale), not the in-memory
 *    catalog — a conflicting row written by another process/replica and
 *    not yet polled in here must still be caught.
 *  - Every write's response and audit event are built from the data just
 *    written (what we know is true), never from a post-write re-read of the
 *    catalog — so a refresh failure can never turn a successful write into
 *    an unaudited one, or into an error.
 *  - `deps.refresh` is still called best-effort after each write (so this
 *    process's own routing picks up the change promptly); a failure is
 *    logged and swallowed, never thrown.
 *  - `set_model` additionally re-checks ownership after a *successful*
 *    refresh: two processes racing to claim the same model id under
 *    different providers can both write (the compound key is
 *    (provider, modelId), not modelId alone) — `buildCatalog` then silently
 *    picks one winner. If the merge didn't pick us, we report an error
 *    rather than success, even though our own row did get written.
