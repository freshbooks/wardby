/**
 * `wardby scheduler` is a long-running process that dispatches scheduled coding runs through its
 * own Kubernetes-backed executor (built directly in `scheduler()`, not via `startMcp`), so its first
 * scheduled run would otherwise still pay the lazy cluster-preflight cost `warmUp` exists to avoid.
 *
 * `cli.ts` can't safely be imported in a test: `main()` runs unconditionally at module scope (it is
 * always dynamically `import()`-ed exactly once, by `wardby-bin.ts`, as the real CLI entry point) and
 * would dispatch on vitest's own `process.argv` and call `process.exit`. This guards the warm-up
 * wiring at the source level instead — the same technique
 * `providers/coding-proxy/mock-upstream-deploy-guard.test.ts` uses for deploy manifests it can't
 * safely execute either.
