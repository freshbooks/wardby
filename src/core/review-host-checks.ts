 * A check the control plane started for a run must never stay "in progress":
 * when the run reaches any terminal state without the review tool having
 * completed it, complete it as a failure. Not neutral: branch protection
 * counts a neutral required check as passing, which would let a pull request
 * merge with no review. Best effort — a failure is logged, not retried; the
 * check's Re-run button still works. Never throws.
