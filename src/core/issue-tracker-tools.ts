/**
 * Built-in issue-tracker tools (`jira_*`) for native agents with at least one
 * AgentIssueProject link. Like the repo_* built-ins (review-host-tools.ts)
 * they are synthesized by the runner, recognized by name, and never run in
 * the sandbox. The security boundary is here: every call resolves to a Jira
 * project, which must be one of this agent's links and still be linked right
 * now (with write access for write tools); searches are scoped to the linked
 * projects. The control plane holds the credential, so the model never sees
 * a token. Every comment carries this agent's footer, which is also what
 * jira_edit_own_comment checks ownership against. Issue text reaches the
 * model as a tool result, which the engine fences as untrusted
 * (engine-native.ts), so it is not wrapped again here. Never throws —
 * failures are JSON tool results.
 *
 * Phase 2 adds write tools beyond comments (transitions, field edits, issue
 * links, issue properties). Each authorizes the issue's resolved project
 * against the live link like jira_comment does, and each is further bounded
 * by a per-link allowlist that fails closed: an empty allowedTransitions or
 * writableFields refuses every transition or field edit, and an empty
 * allowedLinkTypes refuses every issue link. jira_link_issues needs write on
 * both issues' projects and the link type in both projects' allowlists.
 * Issue properties are not allowlisted (any write link may set them); they
 * are namespaced by wardby as `wardby.<agentId>.<property>`, so an agent
 * cannot read or overwrite another app's or another agent's properties
 * through these tools.
 *
 * Phase 4 adds jira_create_issue and jira_read_attachment. Creating needs a
 * live write link to the target project, an issue type in that link's
 * creatableIssueTypes (fails closed), custom fields in its writableFields,
 * and a parent (if any) in a live write-linked project, by key and by resolved
 * project. A link's optional maxNewIssuesPerRun caps the issues one run
 * creates in that project; the counter lives in the per-run context, floored
 * by the run's recorded fingerprint creates so a resumed attempt cannot reset
 * it. Fingerprinted creates go through fileIssue (issue-dedupe.ts).
 * jira_read_attachment reads only an attachment listed on an issue in a
 * linked project.
 * See docs/private/2026-09-30-jira-issue-tracker-design.md.
