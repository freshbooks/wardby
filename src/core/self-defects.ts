/**
 * Self-defects: when a run of an opted-in agent (Agent.defectProjectKey +
 * defectIssueType) ends failed, lost or budget_exhausted, the control plane
 * (no model involved) files a defect for it through fileIssue, deduped by a
 * structural fingerprint so a recurring failure becomes "seen again" comments
 * on one issue rather than a new issue per run.
 *
 *   fingerprint  self:<agentId>:<status>:<category>
 *   category     CodingRun.failureCategory, else the leading `code:` token of
 *                Run.error, else "unknown" — only ever a closed-shape token
 *                (lower-case letters/underscore), never the error's free text
 *
 * Fails closed: the agent needs a live write link to defectProjectKey whose
 * creatableIssueTypes includes defectIssueType; otherwise it logs and skips.
 * Self-defects are not counted against the link's maxNewIssuesPerRun: that cap
 * bounds what a run's model may create, while this is a control-plane action
 * whose volume the fingerprint dedupe already bounds (one open issue per
 * agent/status/category).
 *
 * Filed by whichever write made the run's row terminal (its update count says so, so a run files once): the
 * runner, the container store, the reconciler, the coding queue's timeout, a failed executor start
 * (markRunFailedFromExecutorError) and DBOS recovery's mark-failed.
 *
 * Best effort and never throws. No recursion: this is only ever called after a
 * run's row is final, outside any run, and a failure to file only logs — it
 * never fails a run, so it can never trigger another filing.
